Place broccoli florets, sliced bell pepper, sliced garlic, olive oil, salt, and pepper on a jelly-roll pan; toss to coat. If the peppers start cooking too quickly, reduce the heat to medium-high. Drizzle the vinegar over the peppers and shake the pan vigorously for a few seconds (The vinegar will evaporate almost instantly as the pan is quite hot by now). In part it may be that carrot color and flavor are linked: early carrots that were more yellowy-orange contained a more palate-pleasing balance of the phytochemicals that govern carrot flavor.

##### Instructions to make Multi colored Pulav with broccoli, red and orange bell peppers, and carrots:

1. Collect the required ingredients; keep them within your reach

Drizzle the vinegar over the peppers and shake the pan vigorously for a few seconds (The vinegar will evaporate almost instantly as the pan is quite hot by now). In part it may be that carrot color and flavor are linked: early carrots that were more yellowy-orange contained a more palate-pleasing balance of the phytochemicals that govern carrot flavor. People selected and bred toward orange ones for table use, over those at the purple or red ends of the spectrum. What to Look For: All red, yellow, and orange peppers start out green. The color and taste change depending on how long they&#39;re allowed to ripen on the vine.
