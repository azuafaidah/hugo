This cheesy asparagus potato tart takes three of my favorite things - crisp puff pastry, cheesy mashed potatoes made with creamy yogurt, and fresh asparagus - and turns them into so much more than the sum of three parts. Mix cream cheese, egg yolks, Parmesan cheese and seasoning and spread onto the puff pastry. Lay fresh asparagus on top of the cream cheese mixture then season with salt and pepper. Brush the border of pastry with beaten egg and place in a hot oven to bake until the pastry is golden and crisp.
