The steam will stop your cheesecake from drying out, ensuring zero cracks. You also want to make sure you thoroughly grease your springform pan so that nothing sticks and your cheesecake can rise evenly. On the day, loosen the sides of the cheesecake from the tin with a knife and remove the base (although I usually serve it straight from the tin base). Add a large pinch of flaky sea salt to the rest of the caramel sauce, then spoon it over the cake and swirl with the back of the spoon. Refrigerate overnight, covering when completely cooled.
