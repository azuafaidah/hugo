Chinese cuisine is diverse, delicious, and — with the right recipes — totally beginner-friendly. A notable difference between Chinese and Western cuisine is the importance of grains. Chinese cooking is really grain- and vegetable-based, with meat, seafood, or poultry playing more of a secondary role. A proper Chinese meal always contains an equal balance of fan (grains, rice or other starches) and cai (cooked meat and vegetables). The comfort dish of Chinese food.
