recipeingredient:
- " Pork Roast"
- " Onion"
- " Carrots"
- " Potatoes"
- " Any other veggies you prefer"
- " Season"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place Port Roast into Crock. Season with preferred seasonings. I use Rosemary &amp; Celery Seed. Cut up some onion &amp; place on top of the roast. Cover &amp; cook on High 6-8 hours or Low 8-10 hours. I flip the roast occasionally so the bottom doesn&#39;t get too crispy. You don&#39;t need to add liquid to the roast. It will produce it&#39;s own juices. If you want to add something; a little water would be fine. Depending on the size of roast adjust your cooking time."
- "About 3 1/2 hours before you&#39;re ready to serve the roast; pull roast apart into several pieces. It should be easy to pull apart by this time. Place potatoes, carrots, more onion &amp; any other veggies you&#39;d like on top of the roast. Tip - If you&#39;re going to add fresh green beans or asparagus I would wait until the last 1 1/2 hour to place them inside so they aren&#39;t soggy."
- "At this point your roast should be cooked to perfection. Slice up &amp; enjoy!"
