recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 210°c. This temperature is for a fan oven."

- "Put the potato chunks into a container with a secure lid, I use a pot. And pour the butter over them."

- "Then repeat what you did with the potatoes. Put the carrots into the same container. Add 28g melted butter, 1 tsp dried mixed herbs, 1/2 tsp paprika and 1/2 tsp garlic powder. Put the lid on and shake until the carrots are completely covered."
- "Add the carrots to the same tray as the potatoes. Try not to overlap them if you can. Then set aside again."
- "Peel two onions (for 4 people, adjust quantities as needed) and chop off the ends. Then cut each onion into eighths. Add to the tray, spreading them in between the potatoes and carrots."
- "Cover the tray with aluminium foil and put into the oven for 45 minutes. Then remove from the oven and carefully take off the foil. The vegetables will be soft but colourless."
- "Place back into the oven for a further 30 minutes without the foil on to crisp up and go brown. Then serve with your roast dinner, or with anything else you like."
