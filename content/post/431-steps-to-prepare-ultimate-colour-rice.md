Pour in the rice and close the bag. (You better close the bag unless you want to change the color of your kitchen, LOL). To colour rice, all you need is the exactly the same technique as used to colour dry pasta. Basically you need the colouring and a carrier to spread the colouring through the rice. I have used both vinegar and hand sanitiser as carrying agents. How to color rice with rubbing alcohol Pour rice on paper towel lined cookie sheet. (This helps it dry quicker) It might be slightly smelly of the rubbing alcohol so you may want to do this on a day you can open windows or better yet can put the tray outside to dry quicker in the sun!
