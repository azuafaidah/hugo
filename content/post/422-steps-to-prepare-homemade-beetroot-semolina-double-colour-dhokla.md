Sieve besan flour and transfer to a mixing bowl. Add semolina, salt, chili paste, lemon juice, beetroot puree and curd. To make Beetroot Dhokla more interesting I used cup cake mould rather than regular steamers and then used hung curd for giving a feel of icing. Infact if you increase the beetroot puree content and add little more hung curd on top your savory cake would blend well with a feel of red velvet cake.

To make Beetroot Dhokla more interesting I used cup cake mould rather than regular steamers and then used hung curd for giving a feel of icing. Infact if you increase the beetroot puree content and add little more hung curd on top your savory cake would blend well with a feel of red velvet cake. Mix well to form a nice batter. There is no need to add water as the water from the beetroot and yogurt should be enough to bind the mixture. Add enough water to form a thick batter.
