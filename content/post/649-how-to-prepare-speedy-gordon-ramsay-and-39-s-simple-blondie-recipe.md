recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat your over to 350° F and place enough parchment paper in an 8 inch x 8 inch square cake tin to cover the bottom and sides"
- "Melt the butter in a saucepan"
- "Once the butter is melted, whisk in the sugar and salt"
- "Add the vanilla extract to the mix. Once mixed, remove from the heat and pour into a larger mixing bowl"
- "Add the eggs to the mixture and whisk again"
- "Add the baking soda, baking powder and 1/2 a cup of the flour to the mixture and mix thoroughly. It is important to add the flour in stages to prevent lumps"

- "Scoop the batter into the cake tin and spread it evenly throughout the inside"
- "Bake in the oven for 35-40 minutes. I prefer only 35 minutes as I like the insides of the blondies to be nice and gooey"
- "Let the blondies cool for at least 10 minutes before slicing"
