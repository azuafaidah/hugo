Thai Flower Shortbread Cookies - Khanom Kleeb Lum Duen If you&#39;re looking for a pretty, cute and fun to make cookie recipe, look no further. I give you khanom kleeb lum duen, Thai shortbread cookies shaped into flowers of the region and then smoked with a special perfumed candle to instill fragrance into the cookies. People don&#39;t usually refer to these scented, flower-shaped treats as &#34;shortbread cookies&#34; in Thailand. What I mean is that if you visit Bangkok and go around asking people to direct you to a place where they sell &#34;Thai shortbread cookies,&#34; you&#39;ll most likely get a bunch of knitted brows, tilted heads, rapid blinks, and complete silence.
