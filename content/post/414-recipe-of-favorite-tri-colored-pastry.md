Tri-Color Rotini A colorful version of a pasta salad favorite, Tri-Color Rotini means &#34;colorful twists&#34; and are two-inch lengths of thick screw-like pasta from Northern Italy. The shape was inspired by children, since they are fun to eat and pair well with a wide variety of sauces. Barilla® Tri-Color Rotini is made with non-GMO ingredients. When I lived in New York, I used to get this delicious tri-color cookie from the Italian Bakery every year for the holidays.

This technicolor cookie features layers of almond cake that are sandwiched with apricot jam and coated in chocolate. Italian Rainbow cookies, sometimes also called Venetians, Neapolitans, or Tri-color cookies, are gorgeous and loaded with flavor. Growing up, I don&#39;t remember making these cookies at home. They always came from a bakery.

Growing up, I don&#39;t remember making these cookies at home. They always came from a bakery. Once I learned how easy they are to make, they have become a must for my Christmas sweet table. Stir the red food coloring into the first bowl of batter until evenly pink colored, then stir the green color into the second bowl of batter until evenly green colored, leaving the third bowl. To achieve that traditional look of the tri-colored polvorones, I would suggest using a pastry cutter to cut the cookies.
