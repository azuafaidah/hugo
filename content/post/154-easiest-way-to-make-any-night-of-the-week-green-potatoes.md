Potatoes will often go green when they&#39;re not stored properly and they&#39;re exposed to light. This is due to formation of chlorophyll (which is found in all green plants), however the green colour is a useful indicator that levels of certain toxins that are harmful to humans, known as glycoalkaloids, may be increased. A: The potatoes with a green tint to the skin will taste bitter. If just a light green, then trim off the green skin or flesh and boil, bake or prepare as usual.

A: The potatoes with a green tint to the skin will taste bitter. If just a light green, then trim off the green skin or flesh and boil, bake or prepare as usual. However, with what I have been seeing in retail grocery stores lately on display, I would caution you to not automatically pick up potatoes for purchase that have turned very green. Have you ever been told to avoid the green part of some potatoes because they&#39;re poisonous? Potatoes, and especially any green part of the plant, contain a toxic chemical called solanine.
