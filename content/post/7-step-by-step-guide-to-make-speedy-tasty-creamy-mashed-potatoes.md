recipeingredient:
- " Potatoes"
- " Salt"
- " Butter"
- " Milk"
recipeinstructions:
- "First, you need to know how much you&#39;re making. So take a pot (one with a lid available), and put an amount of potatoes in it to help you visualize the amount you&#39;re gonna get from them"
- "Peel potatoes then wash them"
- "Cut them up into pieces, smaller pieces cook faster, try not to make them too small. Then put them into the pot"
- "Fill the pot with water and (using the lid) pour out the water to give them a final wash"
- "Pour water again into the pot just so that the potatoes are covered with water (it&#39;s okay if they slightly poke out"
- "Add a fair amount of salt. So for my pot here I added about 5 teaspoons."
- "Note: not all of the salt will deep into the potatoes, a lot of it will stay in water, but the more you add the more will enter the potatoes"
- "Cook the potatoes on medium to high heat, and put the lid on"
- "When it seems to almost boil over, move the lid a bit so there is a gap, you can also lower the heat a tiny bit but make sure that you have on medium at the very least"
- "To check if they&#39;re cooked you can do two things: 1) use a knife and try to stab one potato, if it goes in nicely then atleast he outside is cooked 2) lift the knife above the water with the potatoe still impaled, if it slides off then the middle is also mostly cooked and may be ready"
- "Once cooked, use the lid like in step 4 to pour out the water"
- "Add a fair amount of butter (I used a quarter of a 250g butter brick)"
- "Use this bad boy to mash the potatoes a bit"
- "Add some milk to your potatoes (I used about half a cup) and continue mashih until it&#39;s mashed well"
