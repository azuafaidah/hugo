Do not allow the potatoes to cook fully, what you want is for the surface area to be fluffy when scraped with a knife but not soft in the centre, drain in a colander and leave to steam dry for a few minutes. Then transfer back into the pot."
- "Toss the potatoes around in the pan to rough up the edges, you can see in the 2nd image how fluffy the surface is. select a rimmed baking or roasting tray and add the duck fat or oil or lard."
- "Space out the potatoes on the tray or trays so that there is some gaps to allow the heat to crisp up all the surface, add a little oil to stop the fat burning then roast at 230c - 450f for about 20 minutes or until the bottom edges are super crispy. Turn them over and return to the oven for a further 10 - 15 minutes."
- "Serve on a plate or in a bowl for the family to dive into, I used the fork test for crispness and my god they were amazingly crunchy and fluffy in the centre. Best Roasties ever people. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wIc8e-qb8U&amp;t=33s"
