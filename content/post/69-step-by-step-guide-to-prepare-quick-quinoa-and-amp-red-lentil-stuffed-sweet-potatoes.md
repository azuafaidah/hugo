- "Add all of the ingredients from the lentils through to the curry powder to the pot plus 2 cups of water, bring to a boil then reduce to a simmer with the lid partially covered. Simmer for 10 min."
- "Add the broccoli and bell pepper, stir to combine, and place lid fully on the pot and allow to cook for 5 minutes."
- "Mix all dressing ingredients in a small bowl plus 2 tbsp water. Stir into the quinoa/lentil mixture or serve on the side to drizzle on top. Enjoy!"
