Rolled oats are the best type of oat to use for oat milk. They give a creamier end result than steel cut oats. As for quick oats, these are too processed, and often yield an unpleasantly slimy milk. If you are on a gluten-free diet, be sure to seek out oats labeled gluten-free.


To begin with this recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can cook oat meal and milk using 5 ingredients and 3 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Oat meal and milk:

While oats cook, froth the remaining cup of milk. Remove from heat and stir in the brown sugar and remaining frothed milk. Oat milk can be a nice option for someone with dietary restrictions or food sensitivities because it is naturally free of dairy, lactose, soy and nuts, Edinger says. Oats are also gluten free, but they&#39;re often processed in the same facilities as other grains that do contain gluten, so there&#39;s potential for cross-contamination.
