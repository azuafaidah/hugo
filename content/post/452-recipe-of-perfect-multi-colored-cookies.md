One is for creating cookies that have two or three colors, but the colors don&#39;t mix. The second method mixes two or three colors, creating more of a tie dye effect.

Remove the dough from the refrigerator and peel off the top pieces of wax paper from each half of dough. Flip the colored dough half over onto the white dough half so that dough is touching dough. When I lived in New York, I used to get this delicious tri-color cookie from the Italian Bakery every year for the holidays. Once I moved down south, I was no longer able to get them.

When I lived in New York, I used to get this delicious tri-color cookie from the Italian Bakery every year for the holidays. Once I moved down south, I was no longer able to get them. The directions seem long and scary, but these cookies are actually very easy to make. I hope you enjoy them as much as my family and friends do. Divide dough evenly into five bowls, and color each with a different color liquid food coloring. (We used Betty Crocker neon shades in pink, green, blue and purple, as well as the yellow from a standard pack).
