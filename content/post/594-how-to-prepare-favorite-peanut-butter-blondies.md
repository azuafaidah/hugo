recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a 9x13&#34; pan with parchment paper, leaving it hanging slightly over the side (this will make it easy to lift out of the pan to cut) and set aside."
- "In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the melted, cooled butter and brown sugar until combined. Then whisk in the 2 eggs and the yolk. Next, whisk in the vanilla extract."
- "Add the flour, baking powder and salt to the bowl. Fold everything together with a rubber spatula. Batter will be thick."

- "Spread the batter into your prepared baking pan. For prettier blondies, press a few additional of whatever you mixed in, onto the top of the batter."
- "Bake for 30 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out mostly clean, but with just a few moist crumbs on it (similar to when you make brownies). After the 30 minute mark, if they&#39;re not done yet, check every couple of minutes, so they don&#39;t overbake."
- "Once the pan is removed from the oven, place on a wire rack. Allow to cool completely before cutting them into squares."
- "Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week."
