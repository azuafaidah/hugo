People likely won&#39;t even notice that these delicately nutty, just a little chocolaty, blondies are gluten-free. They use quinoa flour, which you can find in well-stocked supermarkets and natural-foods stores, in place of all-purpose flour. To make your own quinoa flour, grind raw quinoa into a powder in a clean coffee grinder. (Adapted from Quinoa Revolution by Patricia Green and Carolyn Hemming.) Cream together the butter and almond butter with an electric mixer until lightens in color and is a bit fluffy. Then beat in the eggs, sugar, and vanilla, again beating until the batter is a bit fluffy.
