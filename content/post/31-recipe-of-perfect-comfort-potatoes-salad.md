Before I wrap up all my summer recipes and suddenly come at you with cinnamon-pumpkin-autumn everything… it&#39;s time to introduce. This is a very popular restaurant potato salad. Different kinds of potatoes &#34;behave&#34; differently when cooked, mostly because of their starch content. I think the best potatoes for potato salads are Yellow Finn potatoes, new potatoes, red-skinned potatoes, white round potatoes, and purple potatoes.
