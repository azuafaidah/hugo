They should look similar to this. Potatoes store longer dried than they do in the freezer, which is a plus, and there is no freezer burn or bad taste. You can can also slice the potatoes (cooking first as I described above) instead of grating them and use them for things like scalloped potatoes. Potatoes can be stored for a long time if you have a cool, dark, dry place to store them. But, if you&#39;re like us and don&#39;t have a dry, dark, cool place to store food - dehydrating potatoes is a good option.
