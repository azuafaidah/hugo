Oil-free roasted potatoes are a perfect side dish when looking for whole food plant based potato recipes. Since potatoes are back on the menu, (see this article, &#34;Potatoes: To Eat or Not to Eat&#34;) I&#39;m looking for ways to use them without any added fat. I like steaming instead of boiling them since it keeps more of the nutrients in the potato instead of leaching out into the water. There are many reasons to love potatoes.
