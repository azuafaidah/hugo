Steaks in Green Sauce (Salsa Verde) with Squash. Having grown up in a household where almost every guisado (everyday stews) had lots of vegetables in it, it&#39;s common for me to always add some sort of veggies to my dishes when cooking at home. And this recipe for steaks in green sauce is a good example of it. Beef: Flank steak, skirt steak, ribeye or top sirloin will all work great in this recipe.
