Salmon is America&#39;s favorite fish, making it a great choice for Sunday dinner. This recipe calls for baking steaks or fillets in a sour cream and dill sauce accented by zesty lemon. Pot roast may not be the easiest dish to make, but you can definitely make things easier by using the slow cooker. And for an even more tender and flavor-packed meal, let your roast cook in a red wine sauce. Pasta and spinach can be cooked together, and fish and vegetables easily baked in a parchment packet, and, of course, sausage and beans practically cook themselves.
