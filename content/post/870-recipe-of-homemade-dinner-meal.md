Tons of these recipes accomodate all sorts of special diets like vegetarian, keto and many more! Many of these dinners can also be made ahead of time and stored for days to come. A sheet pan dinner—like the delicious chicken fajitas recipe—is another easy-to-make meal that&#39;s also fun to get the kids involved with. &#34;You can show little ones how to chop safely and let them have fun arranging the dish,&#34; Ree Drummond says. You can cook everything you need for your meal—in this case, chicken leg quarters and sweet potato wedges—at the same time, and on the same dish. This saves you time, mess, and a whole lot of effort.
