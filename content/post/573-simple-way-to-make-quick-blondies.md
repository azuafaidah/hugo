Light brown sugar works, but the flavor will not be as rich. Blondies are occasionally referred to as &#34;blonde brownies&#34;. They are made without cocoa powder and aspire to a rich vanilla flavor rather than a deep chocolate one. Blondies are also often made with brown sugar, and while I do use brown sugar in my brownies, the flavor has a more noticeable affect in the blondies (more on that below).
