recipeinstructions:
- "Peel and cube the potatoes, parboil and cool. You don’t need to do this first but it does make them easier to cook and I find that they are not so oily. You can cook as below or in the oven by spraying with oil and baking in the oven on a high heat until crispy. I have a garlic rapeseed oil which does the job perfectly."

- "Chop your herbs, squeeze with lemon juice and sprinkle with sea salt. You can combine with the potatoes at this stage but if I’m serving cold I prefer to save half of the herbs to combine at the last minute, it helps them to stay fresh and vibrant. Serve with an extra wedge of lemon 🍋"

That literally translates to spicy potatoes, as these potatoes pack in some heat from the crushed red pepper flakes. Harissa spices up roasted potatoes with a Middle Eastern twist for an exotic addition to breakfast, brunch, or meze spread. Not for the meek of palate, this dish is meant to be spicy -with both harissa and red chile flakes, no sriracha or hot sauce is needed! Batata Harra literally means spicy or hot potatoes. This is my wonderfully moreish version, based on the Lebanese classic.
