Some of my favorite memories from my childhood are Sunday dinners and the amazing smells that would come from the kitchen as my mom cooked dinner. The minute our coats come out of the closet, soups , stews , and casseroles are fair game (as if we haven&#39;t been making casseroles all summer, anyway!). For some, Sunday Dinner (yes, with a capital D) means a fancy, sit-down affair with dishes you&#39;ve spent all day cooking. In our case, what&#39;s meant to be a relaxing family meal turns into a rush to finish chores while shoveling crackers into our mouth.
