recipeingredient:
- "275 g caster sugar"
- "2 tbsp. water"
- "75 g brazil nuts chopped"
- "100 g butter"
- "200 g white chocolate"
- "1 egg"
- "2 bananas peeled and mashed about 200250g"
- " seeds scraped from 1 vanilla pod"
- "225 g plain flour"
- "1/2 tsp baking powder"
recipeinstructions:
- "Make the brazil nut toffee ahead of the game: bring 75g of the caster sugar to the boil with the 2 tbsp. of water, cook until the temperature reaches 120C or a drop of the caramel sets to hard ball in a glass of cold water – there will be hardly any caramel left in the pan. Turn off the heat, stir in the chopped nuts, turn it out onto a tray and leave to cool – it will set almost instantly. When it’s cold and set, chop in into small pieces."
- "Line a 20cm square tin with parchment and preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas 5. Dice the butter into a bowl, add the chopped chocolate and melt it over a bain-marie or a pan with a little simmering water. Take it off the heat just before it’s all melted, the white chocolate has the propensity to split when heated too much."
- "Transfer the butter and chocolate mixture to a large bowl or the bowl of a standing mixer with a paddle attachment, add the remaining sugar and beat briefly."
- "Beat in the egg, then the mashed bananas and vanilla until smooth and only small bits of bananas appear."
- "Sift in the flour with the baking powder and fold in, then add the chopped brazil toffee nuts and fold those in."
- "Transfer to the tin."
- "Bake for 35 minutes but check after 30 - it should be still a tiny bit wobbly in the middle."
- "Cool completely in the tin before cutting into squares."
