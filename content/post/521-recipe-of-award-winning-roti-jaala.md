Hello everybody, I hope you're having an incredible day today. Today, I'm gonna show you how to make a distinctive dish, roti jaala. It is one of my favorites. For mine, I will make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

A savory crepe typically eaten alongside a fragrant Malaysian chicken curry, roti jala is Malay for &#34;net bread,&#34; referring to the bread&#39;s delicate lace-like design. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, water, coconut milk, eggs, salt, and turmeric until smooth. (If any clumps remain, run mixture through a sieve.) Using a sharp-pointed knife (a corkscrew or nail works just as well), poke three holes in the cap of a plastic water bottle. Fill the bottle with your pancake batter. Roti jala is the classic Malaysian pancake, looking like a small lace doily and tinted with turmeric or, more rarely, food coloring.
