Hey everyone, it's Louise, welcome to our recipe page. Today, we're going to make a special dish, blondie brownies. One of my favorites food recipes. This time, I will make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Blondie Brownies is one of the most favored of recent trending foods in the world. It's easy, it is quick, it tastes yummy. It is appreciated by millions every day. Blondie Brownies is something which I have loved my whole life. They are nice and they look wonderful.

Spread the batter into the prepared pan. Whereas brownies depend on chocolate for their flavor, for blondies it&#39;s all about the brown sugar. This gives the blondies their distinctive molasses flavor. Since brown sugar is the critical flavor here, I suggest using dark brown sugar.


To begin with this particular recipe, we must first prepare a few ingredients. You can have blondie brownies using 8 ingredients and 3 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Blondie Brownies:

1. Get 1/2 cup (1 stick) softened butter
1. Make ready 2 cup brown sugar
1. Take 2 large eggs
1. Prepare 1 tsp vanilla extract
1. Make ready 2 tsp baking powder
1. Get 2 cup all-purpose flour
1. Get 1 1/2 cup m&amp;m candies *or any candy you prefer* **OPTIONAL**
1. Get 1 1/2 cup Chocolate Chips are a great addition as well


Blondies are occasionally referred to as &#34;blonde brownies&#34;. They are made without cocoa powder and aspire to a rich vanilla flavor rather than a deep chocolate one. Blondies are also often made with brown sugar, and while I do use brown sugar in my brownies, the flavor has a more noticeable affect in the blondies (more on that below). In a large bowl, combine the brown sugar, butter, eggs and vanilla just until blended.

In a large bowl, combine the brown sugar, butter, eggs and vanilla just until blended. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt; add to brown sugar mixture. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Instead of an intense chocolatey flavor, blondies have notes of caramel and butterscotch, thanks to brown butter, a key ingredient in many blondie recipes.
