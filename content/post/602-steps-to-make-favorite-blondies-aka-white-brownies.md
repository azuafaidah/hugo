Haole brownies aka blonde brownies are a favorite in our house. Simple yet deliciously chewy vanilla and brown sugar flavored brownie perfect for switching things up from your classic chocolate brownie. If not, it&#39;s time to change that. Blondies are similar to brownies, but instead of the base ingredients including cocoa powder or melted chocolate, we leave that out for more of a vanilla-based bar.

Blondies are similar to brownies, but instead of the base ingredients including cocoa powder or melted chocolate, we leave that out for more of a vanilla-based bar. Think of blondies as brownie&#39;s alter-ego. Blondies are occasionally referred to as &#34;blonde brownies&#34;. They are made without cocoa powder and aspire to a rich vanilla flavor rather than a deep chocolate one.
