Hey everyone, hope you're having an incredible day today. Today, we're going to make a special dish, tip : flavor &amp; color cakes. It is one of my favorites food recipes. This time, I am going to make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Sniper, by far the best tip ive ever seen in my life, until this day it amazes me how much draw I get, and how accurate it is, also sometimes I go very far offset and still no miscue, I know alot of AZ scientists said that tip doesnt matter and its all about offset point, or miscue point or whatever they call it, but I can guarantee you they are wrong, I use a certain tip I go not too far off. The tip sounds almost like glass, but it holds chalk really well, spins the ball and no miscues. My next experiment is in the refrigerator right now, and once that&#39;s done I&#39;m going to really crank one down in the big bench vise and with the tip press. It may end up being a break tip but we&#39;ll see.
