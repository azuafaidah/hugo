recipeingredient:
- " large flour tortilla wraps"
- " eggs"
- " sausages"
- " bacon"
- " potatoes finely cubed sweet potato optional"
- " milk"
- " salted butter"
- " grated cheddar cheese"
- " vegetable oil"
- " Salt and pepper"
- " Optional Extras"
- " button mushrooms quartered optional"
- " small onion finely diced optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 200°C. Combine the potatoes and optional veggies in a bowl. Drizzle with oil, season with salt and toss to coat. Transfer to an even layer on a baking sheet and roast until the potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes."
- "While the veggies roast, heat some oil in a large frying pan to a medium heat. Fry the sausages for about 10-15 minutes, or until golden brown all over. Start cooking the bacon in the same pan about 5 minutes after starting the sausages. Once cooked, cut the sausages in half lengthways. Place the sausages and bacon on a plate and set aside to cool."
- "Whisk together the eggs, milk and salt until combined. Melt the butter in the same frying pan previously used for the sausages and bacon. Add the eggs and cook, stirring occasionally, until mostly set but still moist, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat."
- "Let the eggs, meat and roasted vegetables cool while you set up an assembly station — the eggs, meat and vegetables should be room temperature for best assembly. Tear off 12 squares of aluminum foil. Have your cheese and tortillas standing by. Place a tortilla on top of a piece of foil. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of cheese onto the tortilla. Top the cheese with 1/12 of the roasted vegetables, followed by 2 heaping tablespoons of the scrambled eggs and the meat evenly across the 12 wraps."
- "Roll the wrap tightly by folding the sides over the filling, then rolling from the bottom up."
- "Wrap the tortilla tightly in the aluminum foil and repeat with filling and folding the remaining wraps. Freeze the wraps in a single layer on a baking sheet — they&#39;ll freeze faster and more uniformly this way."
- "To eat: Unwrap and microwave on high for 1 to 2 minutes, until warmed through, or heat in a regular or toaster oven at 175°C for 12 to 15 minutes."
