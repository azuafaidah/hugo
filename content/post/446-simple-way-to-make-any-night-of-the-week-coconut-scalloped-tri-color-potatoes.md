In a small bowl, whisk together the coconut milk, red chili and vinegar paste and salt. Cover the bottom of the casserole dish with a layer of sliced potatoes. To make these vegan scalloped potatoes, I used a blend of coconut milk and cashew milk (any dairy free milk would work). I like this blend of dairy free milks because you get the creaminess of the canned coconut milk, but the nut milk balances the sweetness of the coconut milk. Layer potato slices in a casserole dish on their side, alternating each color, in rows.
