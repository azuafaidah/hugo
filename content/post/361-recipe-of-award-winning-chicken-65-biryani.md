I feel chicken cooked in the usual biryani is not my cup of tea and hence I try to prepare either Chicken Tikka Biryani or this biryani, coz in this way the chicken is cooked and then kept in the dum is really flavourful. Chicken Dum biryani is also my favorite thought its a bit. Pat dry the chicken pieces and keep aside. In a wide bowl add the chicken pieces, bring all the ingredients under &#39; For Marination&#39; and mix well.
