Our foods are an alternative to the preservative filled and sugar-laden snacks that surround us. Editor: Erin, when on the go and in the car, we really like snacky, modular lunches. Try packing a little cooler with a lot of small snacks, and things that will keep well from day to day. Think small cherry tomatoes, cheese sticks, celery stalks, grilled chicken breasts cut into small chunks, a cup of yogurt, a big tossed green salad, and a bag of crackers. Wholemeal bread also contains more vitamins and minerals than many white breads, but has a higher GI than wholegrain breads..
