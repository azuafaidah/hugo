recipeinstructions:
- "In a big mixing bowl, combine together flour, steamed sweet potatoes, yeast, egg, sugar, milk powder. Slowly add the milk bit by bit until you reach the right consistency.

Mix everything well using hook attachment in your stand mixer."

For me, once everything is combined and the dough doesn’t stick to the mixer bowl, I continue kneading the dough with hands and do the window pane stage (when a dough is smooth, translucent, and elastic)"
- "Cover the dough with cling wrap and leave the it until it rises double the size (about an hour). Flatten the dough and divide into desire size"
- "Divide the dough and shape it according to your preference."

- "Butter and milk filling: combine all ingredients together."
- "The bread is very soft even when we keep for the next day."
