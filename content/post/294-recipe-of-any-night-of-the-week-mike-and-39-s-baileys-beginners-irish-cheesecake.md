recipeinstructions:
- "Bring cream cheese to room temperature or heat slightly in your microwave."
- "Add everything in a bowl, except for lemon juice, chocolate chips and garnishments and blend until any lumps are fully dissolved."
- "Important step:  Slowly add your lemon juice and blend with electric mixer to avoid curdling."
