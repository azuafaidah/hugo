- "50 ml Olive oil or melted butter about 3 Tbsp"
- "7 g active dry yeast 2 tsp"
- "10 g brown sugar or honey 2 tsp"
- "300 g Whole wheat flour 2 heaping cups"

recipeinstructions:
- "If not chopped already, chop up your nuts into smaller pieces. Walnuts are nice, or use a mix of your favorites :)"
- "In a small pot, mix milk, water and olive oil/butter. Heat until warm (but not hot!) on low heat. Take of heat and mix in honey/sugar and yeast until dissolved. Warm water is important to activate the yeast so don&#39;t use cold!"
- "Let the liquid sit for 5-10 minutes. You should get little bubbles or foam from the yeast starting to be active."
- "In a large mixing bowl, mix together wheat flour and regular flour."
- "Pour in the liquid mixture, then add the salt last. Start mixing and folding with a spatula to bring the dough together."
- "You want the dough to be moist but not sticky. If the dough is too dry or powdery, add add just a little more milk or water (try a Tablespoon or two at a time). Once the dough comes together, it&#39;s ready to knead!"
- "Dust your kneading surface with plenty of flour and place the ball of dough onto it. Also, dust your hands with plenty of flour to prevent the dough from sticking."
- "First, flatten out the dough a little bit and gently press in the nuts."
- "To knead, fold in the outer edges of the dough toward the center and press down with the palm of your hand each time. Repeat..."
- "Keep folding over and pressing, while rotating the dough around so you can form a big ball."
- "Knead this way for 10 minutes or so until the dough is fairly smooth."
- "Once finished, you&#39;ll have a ball of dough which should be smooth on top and have creases from folding on the bottom."
- "Grease the mixing bowl with just a little oil and put in the ball of dough, crease-side down. Brush the top with a little oil too to help prevent drying."
- "Cover with wrap and set in a warm spot or warm oven for about 1 hour - 1.5 hours. The dough should rise to about double."
- "Squish out the air and shape into the shape you want (e.g. a round or oval loaf). Place on the baking sheet."
- "Beat an egg with a Tablespoon of water and brush top of dough with it. If adding toppings like rolled oats, sesame seeds, etc., sprinkle on desired amount. The egg will give the bread a nice brown color and hold on any toppings while baking but isn&#39;t necessary."
- "Let dough rise for another 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375째F/190째C. Bake for 30-40 minutes (mine only took 30 minutes). Let cool on a rack for a few minutes before digging in!"
