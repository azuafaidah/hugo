The first is a meat bun in the shape of a little piggy. Then, there&#39;s a custard-filled baby chick and two types of bears, a panda and a brown bear, both containing sweet bean paste. Compared to the soft and doughy buns familiar to the Japanese, these authentic-style buns are much more firm, but the fillings are incredibly moist and delicious.
