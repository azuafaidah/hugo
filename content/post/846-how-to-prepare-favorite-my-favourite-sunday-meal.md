Hey everyone, I hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, we're going to prepare a distinctive dish, my favourite sunday meal. One of my favorites. This time, I'm gonna make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Any quick sheet pan supper is a favorite in our book, but especially recipes that diverge from our usual chicken and pork chops. Summer veggies, fresh shrimp, and basmati rice make for a fresh, light Sunday meal. Maybe not your typical Sunday supper, this easy balsamic chicken is one of our favorite alternative Sunday dinner ideas. Meal prep and weekend projects, and enjoying active outdoor fun in the sun, makes for a busy weekend.

My favourite Sunday meal is one of the most well liked of recent trending foods in the world. It's easy, it's quick, it tastes yummy. It's enjoyed by millions every day. My favourite Sunday meal is something that I've loved my whole life. They are fine and they look fantastic.


To begin with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can cook my favourite sunday meal using 5 ingredients and 3 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

##### The ingredients needed to make My favourite Sunday meal:

1. Take  chicken drumsticks
1. Get  Portuguese chicken spice
1. Prepare  barbecue spice
1. Take  \2cup tomato sauce
1. Take  \2 cup mayonnaise


It&#39;s so decadent, but also dairy-free and low carb. These are just a few of my favorite possibilities for Sunday Dinner Main Dishes, plus two of my favorite homemade rolls. Generally they are meals that take a little more time to put together, to cook, or maybe require an ingredient or two that keep them from being a regular on the weeknight dinner table. When I really don&#39;t feel like cooking, but want something healthier than takeout, this is one of my favorite fallbacks.

I hope you find a handful that make your life (or at least your life at dinnertime) easier.
