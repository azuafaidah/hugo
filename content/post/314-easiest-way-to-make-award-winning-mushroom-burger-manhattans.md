Half-pound grilled Angus beef burger, crowned with a fresh fried egg, topped with three strips of bacon, American cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayo. These veggie burgers are easy, and make a great beef alternative that even a meat lover would enjoy. The mushrooms are marinated then grilled and topped with melted Swiss cheese, grilled red onion, tomatoes, spinach, and avocado - yum!! To give the mushroom a meaty flavor, I marinated them with balsamic, soy sauce and Montreal steak seasoning.
