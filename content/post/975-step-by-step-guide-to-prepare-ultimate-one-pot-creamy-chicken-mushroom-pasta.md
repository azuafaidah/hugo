For a similar recipe to this one, I also make an excellent skillet creamy chicken mushroom Florentine. Cook until onions are browned, stirring occasionally. Return the chicken to the pot. Add the stock, cream, wine, and pasta, bring up to a simmer, and cover. *Marsala wine can be purchased at most grocery stores near the dessert or sweet wines and gives the dish a distinct flavor. Since you are using a pretty hot pan to cook the mushroom, the broth should start simmering immediately.
