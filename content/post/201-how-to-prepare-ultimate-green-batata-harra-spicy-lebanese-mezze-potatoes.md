recipeinstructions:
- "Peel and cube the potatoes, parboil and cool. You don’t need to do this first but it does make them easier to cook and I find that they are not so oily. You can cook as below or in the oven by spraying with oil and baking in the oven on a high heat until crispy. I have a garlic rapeseed oil which does the job perfectly."

- "Chop your herbs, squeeze with lemon juice and sprinkle with sea salt. You can combine with the potatoes at this stage but if I’m serving cold I prefer to save half of the herbs to combine at the last minute, it helps them to stay fresh and vibrant. Serve with an extra wedge of lemon 🍋"
