recipeinstructions:
- "Sauté diced onion in olive oil. Meanwhile, blitz all the sauce ingredients till smooth and add into the onion once softened. The gnocchi only takes a couple of minutes to cook in boiling water so this can be done while the sauce is cooking. Drain the gnocchi and lay into a ceramic oven proof dish."

Then pour the tomato sauce all over the cooked gnocchi and dot the top with burrata or mozzarella cheese and a handful of basil leaves. ***Top tip - I only used half the sauce I made for the amount of gnocchi I had and I saved the rest in the freezer for another pasta sauce. You can do the same or use it all for a saucier gnocchi dish.***"
- "You can leave this in the fridge for a few hours if needed or cook it till golden brown (on about 160 degrees for approx half an hour). Serve with a crisp salad, Parmesan over the top and some crusty bread!!"
