This low-carb vegetable soup is chock-full of veggies swimming in a creamy coconut broth flavored with Thai red curry paste. It&#39;s hearty enough to eat on its own, but feel free to add chicken or tofu to boost the protein. I like to use bacon grease for the flavor when sautÃ©ing the vegetables and then crumbling it and adding it to the top. You could mix it in the soup at the end to add more flavor but it won&#39;t be as crispy obviously.
