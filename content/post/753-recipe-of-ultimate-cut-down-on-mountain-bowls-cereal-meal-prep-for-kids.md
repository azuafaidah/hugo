recipeinstructions:
- "1 1/2 cup of cereal in each bag"
- "Place bags in ziplock bags with kids name on them, place bags where you normally keep your cereal, for older kids you may have to hide the bags or box (the original cereal bags/boxes) so they donâ€™t get more when your not looking..... just saying...."
- "Notes- I had 2 bags opened so I used that. I was doing this for 2 children. If you didnâ€™t want to do cereal all 5 or 7 days, you can put in a wrapped poptart, or wrapped breakfast bars, and they can pick what one they like to eat for that day... that is something I plan on trying out myself... my kids love pop tarts."
- "That way they also have different choices and can help save on milk too. For younger kids milk should be measured out and prepped as well in a locked container and kept in the refrigerator obviously ðŸ™„"
