I serve the potatoes with tehina augmented with harissa, the North African condiment based on dried chiles that&#39;s a staple on the Israeli table. In my harissa, I use ground Aleppo pepper from Syria, which has a fruity ï¬‚avor and is not screamingly hot, so you can appreciate the pepper&#39;s earthy undertones. To make the green harissa, toast the cumin and coriander seeds in a pan until fragrant, then tip into a mortar. Cool, crush lightly, then tip into a small blender or food processor.
