recipeingredient:
- " boiled beans"
- " medium boiled sweet potatoes"
recipeinstructions:
- "While your beans are already fully boiled n hot, drain excess water n mash them to almost done."
- "Again while your sweet potatoes are fully boiled n hot, drain excess water then mash them too separately. While almost done, add in your mashed beans n continue mashing till your 2 ingredients are fully combined, mixed n mashed."
- "Note 1. You can as well mash them all together from the word go though i noted a difference in beans. While mashing them separately, they get fully mashed unlike when mashed direct with the sweet potatoes. Just a tip but you can try it your way."
- "Note 2. Salt is optional. Sweet potatoes are too sweet so combination of salt n sweet to me doesnt add up. Again you may try it your way and enjoy. All the best..Western here we come, making every day cooking fun."
- "Enjoy just a small portion just as i said earlier, its too heavy."
