Whole-wheat bread is an excellent alternative to classic white bread: it&#39;s rich in fiber and vitamins - plus, it&#39;s lower in calories, making it ideal if you&#39;re on a diet! And when it comes to flavor, whole-wheat bread has a more rustic and inviting taste than regular white bread. I&#39;ve baked this bread numerous times using just plain white and plain wholemeal (whole wheat) flours and the results are the same as when I&#39;ve used strong (bread flours). The beauty of this wholemeal bread recipe is that it&#39;s no knead!


To begin with this recipe, we must first prepare a few components. You can have whole meal bread using 7 ingredients and 7 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.
