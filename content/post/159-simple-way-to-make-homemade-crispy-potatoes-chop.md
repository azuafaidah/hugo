Just like my meatballs and mashed potato recipe, I was obsessed with making the perfect Place potatoes into a large bowl. Pour over potato cubes, hand-tossing to coat. Ultra Crispy Smashed Potatoes are straight forward to make - boil, squish, drizzle, bake - but there are two little tips I&#39;ve discovered along the way: Let the potatoes steam dry a bit after smashing them. Use butter and a touch of oil. Fill a medium pot halfway with water and set it on medium heat.
