The Potato/Aloo Sagu is prepared in a typical Karnataka style with the addition of onion, green chillies, ginger along with a tempering of chana dal, urad dal and mustard seeds. This Sagu is a bit gravy-ish so that it can be scooped up with a piece of the delightfully puffed pooris. Poori Saagu was one such dish which was prepared many times for breakfast. Although all of us at home enjoy eating piping hot pooris with any accompaniment I don&#39;t make them often due to the fact that it is not the healthiest because of the deep frying that is involved.
