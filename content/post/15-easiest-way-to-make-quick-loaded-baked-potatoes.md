Combine with cheese, sour cream, and a baked potato and you&#39;ve got the key to an easy weeknight meal. Start With a Potato, and Cook It Just about every baked potato in the United States is made with a russet potato, a starchy variety with a thick, papery skin. When cooked, the pectin holding the russet&#39;s cells together breaks down easily, resulting in a more powdery, granular texture. The loaded baked potato rounds were baked perfectly on the baking stones. I didn&#39;t have a baking stone, but a parchment lined rimmed baking sheet does just as well.
