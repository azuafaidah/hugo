recipeingredient:
- "5 large russet potatoes peeled washed and scalloped"
- "1 large white onion finely chopped"
- "2 cloves garlic crushed"
- "1 tsp powdered cumin"
- "1 1/2 tsp turmeric powder"
- "1/2 tsp red chilli powder"
- "1 tsp mild Rajah curry powder"
- "2 cups allpurpose flour"
- " Water"
- " Oil for deep frying not too much"
- "to taste Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Make sure your potatoes are scalloped just enough to maintain grip. You don&#39;t want the slices fippy floppy"
- "Transfer the potato slices to a pot of seasoned water (I generally just add salt but you can add parsley and other herbs too if you like). Bring to a boil until the potatoes just start to cook and drain excess water. Let the potatoes cool for about 10 - 15 minutes"
- "Meanwhile, mix flour and seasoning by whisking until fully combined. Add onions and garlic and mix until coated. You&#39;re adding onions and garlic before the water for even distribution and to ensure they do not sink to the bottom"
- "Add water to the flour mixture to form a paste that&#39;s not too thin nor too thick. Stir to bring everything together"
- "Then heat oil in a pan on medium. Just until the oil is fragrant and almost sizzling hot. Please keep an eye on your oil as you do not want it too hot. Remember we had the potatoes barely cooked so very hot oil will quickly cook the outside without cooking the inside"
- "Deep the cooled potato slices into the flour paste, making sure you get as much paste on each slice as possible. Flavor! Flavor! Flavor!"
- "Deep fry the coated potatoes until cooked and slightly browned"
- "Serve with a dipping sauce of your choice or enjoy with a tomato salsa"
